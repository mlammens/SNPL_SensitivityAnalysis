# Sensitivity Analysis Configuration File
# Purpose: This file contains the input arguments required to run the sensitivity analysis
# scripts.
mp.file.names = SNPL_LO.mp, SNPL_HI.mp
# A comma seperated list of *.mp files used in the sensitivity analysis.  The first element of the list
# MUST be an *.mp file that contains all of the low estimates of parameter values and the last element 
# of the list MUST be an *.mp file that conatins all of the high estimates of parameter values.
#
surv.fec.corr = 0, 0, 0
# A matrix defining the inter-dependence structutre among and within fecundity and 
# survival parameters; E.g.,  1, 1, 0 where 1 is completely dependent and 0 is completely 
# independent.
#
# For Survival and Fecundity there are 6 different possible inter-dependence structures:
# Surv	Fec		SxF		# RandUnif	corrMat 
# corr	corr	corr	1			1, 1, 1
# uncor	uncor	corr	stages		0, 0, 1
# corr	corr	uncorr	2			1, 1, 0
# cor	uncor	uncor	1+stages	1, 0, 0
# uncor	cor		uncor	1+stages	0, 1, 0
# uncor	uncor	uncor	2*stages	0, 0, 0
#
sens.iter = 10
# Desired number of iterations of the sensitibity analysis - this program
# will produce sens.iter number of new *.mp files
#
out.dir = snpl_out
# The base directory for where the new *.mp files should go
#	
out.name = snpl
# The base name for the new *.mp files
#
batch.file = snpl_batch
# Base name for newly created batch file(s)
#	
bat.file.cnt = 1
# The number of batch files to be created.  Using this feature allows the user
# to create multiple batch files, which when executed, will run on multiple processors if available
#
rand.samp = lhs
# Sampling scheme for random variables. Options are 'lhs', 'urand', or 'custom'.
# 'lhs' = latin-hypercube sampling
# 'urand' = uniform random variable sampling
# 'custom' = user defined sampling scheme - requires user to write sampling method into
# directly into 'sensitivity.r' source code.
#
rv.file = snpl_rv.csv
# Name of the file in which either random variables will be saved to or from which random
# variables will be taken from
#	
use.rv.file = FALSE
# TRUE/FALSE Use random variables from rv.file, rather than writing to the rv.file
#	
use.sad = TRUE
# TRUE/FALSE Use stable age (stage) distribution when calculated the stage initial abundance values
#
pop.disp.depend = 0
# Population disperal uncertainty inter-dependence - this is a value of 0 or 1, 0 indicating that
# uncertainty in population dispersal is completely independent (i.e., every dispersal value in a 
# dispersal matrix will be varied with a unique random variable) and 1 indicating that uncertainty in
# population dispersal is completely dependent (i.e., a single random value will be used to vary every
# element of the dispersal matrix).
#
pop.disp.dch.include = TRUE
# Include DCH files when dealing with population dispersal parameters.  This is an important option
# when dealing with population dispersal that may change through time.  If this option is selected
# then pop.disp.depend is ignored, because only one rv value is used to randomly select between 
# potential dispersal scenarios. If this option is selected, then rather than varying dispersal values,
# a dispersal scenario is selected randomly from one of the *.mp files in the mp.file.names list and applied
# to the new *.mp file.
#
pop.kch.include = TRUE
# Include kch files when dealing with population carrying capacity parameters.  This is an important option
# when dealing with population K that may change through time.  If TRUE, then a set of *KCH files
# associated with one of the mp.files will be selected randomly.
